multilink is an R package which implements methodology presented in the manuscript "Multifile Partitioning for Record Linkage and Duplicate Detection" by Serge Aleshin-Guendel and Mauricio Sadinle, published in the [Journal of the American Statistical Association](https://doi.org/10.1080/01621459.2021.2013242) and available on [arXiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2110.03839v1). It handles the general problem of multifile record linkage and duplicate detection, where any number of files are to be linked, and any of the files may have duplicates.
